summary: I knit a bracelet out of brass wire.
---

The bracelet is made of brass wire. I came about the knitting technique in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTCK4_7dYV4).
After knit on a pen like shown in the picture below, it was pulled through increasingly smaller holes resulting in the tight structure observable in the final bracelet.
The latch was bent from thicker brass wire.
