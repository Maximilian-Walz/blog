This pendant is meant to resemble the Compantion Cube from the video game series [Portal](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(series)>).
The cube itself was carved from a pretty white stone I found on the coast of Spain.
It was very hard to carve the details without breaking the stone, since it was quite brittle.
To be able to wear the pendant on a chain, I also bent a little brass cage to hold it.
