As I needed some places to put my drinks and snacks while sitting on my sofa and I also wanted them to have specific dimensions, I decided to build them myself.
Apart from the big table above I also created a smaller one that fits perfectly next to the sofa and has two levels, where the lower one still fits a bottle of Spezi or something similar and has rails to prevent stuff from being pushed off.
