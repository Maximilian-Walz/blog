summary: I created a heart pendant out of two stones I found in a local quarry lake.

Every time a human beeing is near a body of water the same thing happens eventually: Stone skipping.
As I recently visited a local quarry lake with a few friends, it was no different.
While we searched for the perfect stone to throw, a friend of mine found one shaped so perfectly round and flat that you could almost mistake it for a coin.
His stone looked too nice to just throw it back into the water, so we came up with the idea to make jewelry out of it.
I too searched for some nicely formed stones on the beach and came upon a black, flat one and a smaller white one, that was almost in the shape of a heart.

With a little work from my rotary tool I finalized the shape of the white stone and fixed it into a small recess a carve in the black stone.
I also added a little brass piece as an attachment point and covered it with a protective coating.
