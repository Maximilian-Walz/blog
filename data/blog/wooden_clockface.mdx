summary: I like analog clocks. I know a lot of people who find them hard to read compared to their digital counterparts but to me they communicate time in a very distinct way. Growing up, a digital clock on every household appliance wasn't exactly the standard. So the analog clocks that were hanging in basically every room where the ones I learned to read first. And now, having gotten used to them over the years, I don't really have to parse the digits the clock hands are pointing to. I see the angle they're at and get a sense of time passed - just by giving it a quick glance.

## The Backstory
I like analog clocks. I know a lot of people who find them hard to read compared to their digital counterparts but to me they communicate time in a very distinct way. Growing up, a digital clock on every household appliance wasn't exactly the standard. So the analog clocks that were hanging in basically every room where the ones I learned to read first. And now, having gotten used to them over the years, I don't really have to parse the digits the clock hands are pointing to. I see the angle they're at and get a sense of time passed - just by giving it a quick glance.

Despite that, my room hasn't had a analog clock for months now. So I decided to build one.

There are many cool designs out there, sometimes even redefining the ground concepts with stuff like moving the outer ring instead of a shaft in the center or pushing the limits of minimalism. While I really like these ideas, they often require to craft a custom clockwork which is a topic I don't want to tackle right now. So I settled on a more conventional design.

## Building the Clock Face
a piece of wood with pencil markings I got the clockwork by ripping it out borrowing it from an old unused clock I had lying around. The clock face was made out of a spare piece of wood from another project.

I began by drawing a circle on the wooden board to mark out the base size of the clock face along with 6 straight lines through the center to mark the places, where the digits would be.

After giving it a roundish shape with my japanese saw (a Ryoba, to be exact), I did something truly controversial: I used my bench drill as a mill. Yeah, yeah I know... you shouldn't do that... but I'll tell you what: It worked fine for my purpose. I don't own a mill so it worked better than doing it by hand and besides, the wood was quite soft. I also tapered the edges using a similar method.

Next, the clock face needed a little recess for the clockwork casing at the back, in order for the shaft to be able to reach enough out front, to mount the clock hands. I accomplished that by drilling large holes at exactly the right depth, again using the bench drill, and then removing the excess material and smoothing it out with my Dremel.
 

This project is still work in progress. I will update this post soon.
