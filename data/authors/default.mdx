# Hi, I'm Max!
Welcome to my site, where I share the stuff I create in my free time. 
My interests range from [woodworking](/tags/woodworking), [metalwork](/tags/metal-crafting) 
and [jewelry](/tags/jewelry) to [analog photography](/tags/analog-photography) 
and [digital art](/tags/digital-art).   

This site motivates me to make each project the best it can be, providing a platform to showcase my creative journey.
