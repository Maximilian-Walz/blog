# Hi, I'm Max!
Welcome to my site, where I share the stuff I create in my free time. 
My interests range from [woodworking](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/woodworking), [metalwork](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/metal-crafting) 
and [jewelry](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/jewelry) to [analog photography](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/analog-photography) 
and [digital art](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/digital-art).   

This site motivates me to make each project the best it can be, providing a platform to showcase my creative journey.
