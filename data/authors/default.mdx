# Hi, I'm Max!
Welcome to my site, where I share the projects I create in my free time. 
My interests range from [woodworking](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/woodworking) and [metalwork](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/metal-crafting) 
to [jewelry](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/jewelry), [analog photography](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/analog-photography), 
and [digital art](https://maximilian-walz.com/tags/digital-art).   

This site motivates me to make each project the best it can be, providing a platform to showcase my creative journey.
